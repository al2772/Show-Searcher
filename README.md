# Show-Searcher
Takes a csv file of movies with information and sorts them based on the users desires pertaining to the provider that has the movie available. This will output the movies that match the given criteria. The files edited by me in majority are "IShowSearcherBackend.java" and "ShowSearcherBackend.java".
